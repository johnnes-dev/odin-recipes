    <h2>Decrepition</h2>
        <p>
            Ground beef mixed with onion, Panko breadcrumbs, milk, fresh parsley, and seasonings 
            produces an irresistibly tender and juicy meatloaf, and this recipe has the best sweet 
            and tangy glaze that caramelizes in the oven and adds amazing flavor to every bite.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lean Ground Beef:</strong> use 80% or 85% lean meat. Just like with making Hamburgers, 
                    the fat content will make the meatloaf moist and juicy. Avoid super lean ground beef. 
                    You could also substitute half of the ground beef with turkey, pork, or Italian sausage</li>
                <li><strong>Onions and Garlic:</strong> aromatics that add flavor to the meatloaf</li>
                <li><strong>Breadcrumbs and Eggs:</strong> act as binders to hold the meatloaf together. 
                    You could substitute panko breadcrumbs with Italian breadcrumbs or even gluten-free 
                    breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Ketchup:</strong> adds flavor and tenderizes the ground beef. You could substitute 
                    with 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Hydrates the bread crumbs to add moisture and also helps tenderize 
                    the beef for a softer and juicier meatloaf.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Fresh parsley adds freshness to the meatloaf. The Italian 
                    seasoning, salt and pepper enhance the natural flavors of the beef.</li>
                <li><strong>For the Glaze:</strong> combining ketchup, white vinegar, brown sugar, garlic 
                    powder and onion powder create a sweet and tangy glaze. In a pinch, you can substitute 
                    it with your favorite BBQ Sauce.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            I used to make meatloaf in a loaf pan (which works fine, and I included instructions on 
            that below), but baking it on a baking sheet has been a game-changer! It creates crispy edges, 
            cooks faster, makes serving a breeze, and there’s more room for the sauce, which is honestly 
            everyone’s favorite part.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep:</strong>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or foil for easier cleanup, and preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li><strong>Sautee Onion</strong> in a bit of oil over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until softened and golden. Transfer it to a plate and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Meatloaf Mixture:</strong> In a large bowl, add all of the meatloaf ingredients and mix just until well combined (your hands are your best tool for mixing : put on disposable gloves if you want to).</li>
                <li><strong>Shape Meatloaf and Bake:</strong> Add meat to the pan and shape it into a meatloaf about 8 inches long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches tall. Bake uncovered at 350˚F for 40 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Meatloaf Glaze:</strong> In a small bowl, mix all of the ingredients together for the sauce until combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Spread the sauce</strong> over the Meatloaf, then return to the oven and bake an additional 20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 160˚F on an instant-read thermometer. Rest the meatloaf for 10-15 minutes before serving, and it will be much easier to slice.</li>
            </ol>
