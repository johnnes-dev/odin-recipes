    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this classic lasagna recipe, sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy filling, 
            a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then baked until bubbly and browned.
            While there are a few steps, this lasagna recipe is relatively easy to make and has so much flavor.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan 
                    with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
                <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, 
                    add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, 
                    or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
                <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from 
                    scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). 
                    If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            While homemade lasagna may have a few steps, 
            each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!

            <ol>
                <li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.</li>
                <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the 
                    pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
                <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until 
                    the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest: Once removed from the oven, let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes 
                    (up to 45 minutes is fine, it will retain the heat well). This will allow it to thicken 
                    up a bit and help it keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</li>
